# FHIR for Research

**The content in this repository is under active development. Please proceed with caution.**

GitHub Actions automatically builds commits to the `main` branch to <https://mitre.github.io/fhir-for-research>.

----

## Dependencies

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- R
- Jupyter and Python3 (if you use embedded Python)

Python uses `venv` (https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html):

You will need to create a `venv` in `python_env/`:

    python3 -m venv python_env

Then run `source python_env/bin/activate` to activate the `venv`, and the following command to install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you add a dependency, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update the requirements file.

Better git support for Jupyter Notebooks is provided by [`nbdime`](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/) and configured via the `.gitattributes` file. For more information, see [here](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vcs.html).

## Quick start

- Clone this repository
- Run `quarto preview` (this will compile everything, start a local web server, and launch web browser to show the content form the server)

## Checking for broken links

This website contains a number of links to external websites. To identify broken links, the [linkchecker](https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/) can be used:

```sh
linkchecker https://mitre.github.io/fhir-for-research/
```

To use a custom SSL certificate chain, modify `~/.config/linkchecker/linkcheckerrc` to set `sslverify` to the path of the `.crt` file.

## Checking for orphan pages

Orphan pages are standalone pages on a website that have no links leading to them from other parts of the site. Essentially, without the direct URL, a user cannot find these pages. In addition, because search engine crawlers depend on following links from one page to another to index a site, they usually can't discover and index these orphan pages.

To identify them, run the following command:

```python
python scripts/find_orphan_pages.py
```
